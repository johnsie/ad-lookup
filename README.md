# ad-lookup
GUI  for Active Directory user lookups using net.exe

This Windows Form application will allow you to look up the details of any Windows domain user as long as you know their account name can connect to a Domain Controller.

It also allows you to unlock the user or reset their password

I have used this application to quickly look up users and unlock them if they have been locked out.  It saves time because it is quicker than logging into a domain controller.
